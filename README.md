## Overview

One day, while you are at home watching documentaries on nature’s beauty with your friends, ignoring the outside world, you are interrupted by a package that isn’t meant for you.

Driven by the duty to deliver the package destined for your neighbour Platony, you step out of your comfort zone and realise that the world isn’t as you imagined. Pollution fills the air and garbage litters every corner of the street. Amidst the plastic and dirt, only one house stands out: Platony's home.

Your neighbour thanks you for the package, which contains seeds, and asks you if you want to help him clean the planet and improve the environment. Will you accept his proposal, facing the truth, or will you refuse to leave your blissful ignorance?
